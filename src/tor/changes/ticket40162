  o Minor features (authorities):
    - Authorities now list a different set of protocols as required and
      recommended.  These lists are chosen so that only truly recommended
      and/or required protocols are included, and so that clients using 0.2.9
      or later will continue to work (even though they are not supported),
      whereas only relays running 0.3.5 or later will meet the requirements.
      Closes ticket 40162.
