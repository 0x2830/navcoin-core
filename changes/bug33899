  o Minor bugfixes (IPv6, relay):
    - Consider IPv6 addresses when checking if a connection is canonical.
      In 17604, relays assumed that a remote relay could consider an IPv6
      connection canonical, but did not set the canonical flag on their side
      of the connection. Fixes bug 33899; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
    - Log IPv6 addresses on connections where this relay is the responder.
      Previously, responding relays would replace the remote IPv6 address with
      the IPv4 address from the consensus.
      Fixes bug 33899; bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
